BamMap utilities including
* Utilities / workflows for copying GDC data (CPTAC3 BAM, FASTQ files) from one 
system to another.  
* Update BamMap information.  

Work here began as ad hoc analyses / fixes implemented as independent workflows, and those
workflows are reteained more or less independently in workflows in their own directories.
Motivation is to keep all such workflows and utilities in one place to make life easier and
create common codebase.  

# Workflows

## Workflow directory structure

Workflows in A_XXX, B_XXX, with each of these serving as ready-working example
workflows which are developed in place for different projects.  Common codebase in ./src, etc.
May need to tighten up strucutre in future

## A Update sample names
./A_update_sample_names from shiso:/Users/mwyczalk/Projects/CPTAC3/CPTAC3.Cases/20201109.update_sample_names

## B Upload to MGI
Transfer data between systems

## C FSCK
Contents of fsck branch moved to own workflow.  May want to merge code from here to common
codebase
